## 🚀 About the Project

**DDS Encoder** is a modern web application developed to process your DirectDraw Surface (DDS) files directly through your web browser. It processes your data safely and quickly by running entirely on the client side, without the need for server-side uploads.

## ✨ Systems and Features

This project includes the following core systems:

* **Fast and Local Processing:** Files are not sent to a server; they are processed instantly in the browser's memory.
* **Modern User Interface (UI):** A clean, intuitive, and easy-on-the-eyes design.
* **Modular Structure:** An easily developable and customizable code architecture.

## 🎨 Color and Theme Palette

The application's interface is built on the following modern color palette to enhance the user experience.

| Color Type | Hex Code | Preview | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | `#111111` | ⬛ | Dark theme background color, prevents eye strain and provides high contrast. |
| **Accent** | `#01E08B` | 🟩 | Used for buttons, highlights, and important actions (Call to Action). |
| **Text** | `#FFFFFF` | ⬜ | Primary readable text color. |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project was developed with "Vanilla" web technologies, without using any frameworks:

* **HTML5:** Structural design.
* **CSS3:** Styling, animations, and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** File processing logic and dynamic DOM interactions.
